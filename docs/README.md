# Analysis Note

This folder will contain the short analysis note with figures.
Suggested outline:
- Dataset summary (time span, sampling rate, gaps)
- Derived signals (vertical speed, ground track)
- Phase segmentation approach
- Key metrics (climb gradient, TAS stability, descent energy rate)
- Observations and caveats
